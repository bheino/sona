# Sona - Home Network Documentation

Sona is a project I'm doing to document my home network. I started it to:

- Get an **overview** of my setup
- Trace **decisions** I made retroactively
- Make sensible decisions for future **enhancements**

But really, it's all about learning new stuff and having fun doing it! :dizzy:
