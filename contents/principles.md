# Principles 
When thinking about how my home network should be set up, I want to follow certain principles to guide me. These principles should help me keep the following factors as low as possible:

- **Costs** - As someone interested in technology, it's easy to spend money on hardware you don't need. Therefore, acquisition and operating costs should be appropriate for the intended use.
- **Time Expenditure** - If you spend more time keeping the infrastructure running than using it for its actual purpose, something is wrong.
- **Complexity** - Since I already deal with complex issues in my job, I want to keep things as simple as possible in my private life. This leaves more time for the really important things in life.

## Low-Complexity

## Separation of Concerns

## Fire & Forget
After the initial setup, I want to spend as little time as possible dealing with the infrastructure. It should just work! A low inherent complexity is necessary for this. Furthermore, automating tasks plays a central role in minimizing maintenance effort even further. This includes things like:

- Operating System updates
- Service updates
- Backups
- Hardware shutdown/startup
